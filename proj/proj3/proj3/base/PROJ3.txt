Fully complete.

Megan did 3.1 and 3.2.

Mikhail did 3.3.

Brian did 3.4 and 3.5, but all teammates contributed to 3.5.

We worked on this by individually doing 3.1-3.4 and sharing code, then meeting up to discuss how to implement 3.5.

All test cases work, only thing is that background process causes "zombie!" to print when background process is waiting for completion of first foreground process that runs after background to reap the background. This follows the logic of test case 7, though.
